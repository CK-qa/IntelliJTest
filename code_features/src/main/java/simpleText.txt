This dialog is displayed every time you compare two files or two versions of a file (local changes or changes between local files and their revisions in a remote repository). You can compare files of any types, including binaries and .jar files.

Note that you can open the differences viewer without running IntelliJ IDEA. To do this, execute the following command:
<path to IntelliJ IDEA executable file> diff <path_1> <path_2>
path_1path_2

The differences viewer provides a powerful editor that enables code completion, live templates, etc.

	Use these buttons to jump to the next/previous difference.

When the last/first difference is hit, IntelliJ IDEA suggests to click the arrow buttons F7/⇧F7 once more and compare other files, depending on the Go to the next file after reaching last change option in the Differences Viewer settings.

This behavior is supported only when the Differences Viewer is invoked from the Version Control tool window.
